The algorithm was trained on a single person of our group (so we don't assure the generalization of the system as we will discuss during the presentation of our project). 
If you want to test the code you can follow the following steps:
- run "main"
- Here you have multiple choices to test the algorithm.
  .To test the "eye blinking" part, you can use any image of a face that you want (you can also use the image "face_detected_true" that can be found within the directory). 
   Put it on an external device and show it to the webcam (after 30 seconds the result "Fake face" will be returned due to missed blinking).
  .To test the feature extraction and SVM part, you can either use "face_detected_fake" or "face_detected_true" and substitute line 39 of the main program with one of them.
   In this case even if the system captures a certain face, it will use the one that we have provided to you. Thanks to that you will be able to test that the system returns true/false
   depending on the type of image you use.
  .During the discussion of the project, we will show you the result obtained by putting the person used for training the system in front of the camera.
